      Appendix: <a href="/assets/pdf/Online_Appendix_Final_Version.pdf">Online Appendix</a>
      Abstract: "Conventional monetary policy involves actions by the monetary and fiscal authorities \: the
                former sets a nominal interest rate and the latter sets lump-sum taxes to finance the implied flow of
                interest payments on government debt. We model such policy within an overlapping generations framework
                and show that absent any other frictions the magnitude of the nominal interest rate gives rise
                to asset substitution between government debt and either private debt or capital substitution which has
                both real and nominal effects. Such substitution is not in standard New Keynesian models because those
                models use a dynastic specification in which government debt is not net wealth."

      year: 2022
      description: 
      Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of access to different financing choices on young firms'
                  future growth paths. According to the Kauffman Firm Survey data, over 2/3 of debt firms rely on credit
                  card borrowing in the first five years of development. I construct a firm life-cycle model with financing
                  constraints to address selection issues involved in the endogenous financing decisions. In this model,
                  firms can simultaneously choose up to three debt financing sources--business bank loans, personal bank
                  loans, and credit card borrowing. I find many firms increase their debt leverage, particularly through
                  credit card borrowing, to avoid shrinking their businesses in bad times. Also, without credit card borrowing,
                  debt firms quickly clear their debt within 4 years of development and assets accumulation level
                  can drop by 11%. In the counterfactual analysis, I estimate how young firms react to the increasing
                  financing cost caused by the local bank industry concentration. The increasing financing cost can lead
                  to a rise in the ratio of debt firms with business bank loans by forcing firms that rely on credit card
                  borrowing to clear their outstanding debt. When the financing cost is not too high for business loan
                  borrowers, this selection mechanism can shift the firm size distribution to the right.

      year: 2022
      description:     
      Abstract: In common value English auction, bidders may have different levels of private information
                  about the selling item. Due to the learning effect of the common value part, bidders with more
                  precise information may be able to manipulate the auction outcome through strategic bidding behavior.
                  However, English auctions are usually challenged by model incompleteness problem (Bikhchandani et
                  al., 2002). To overcomes the identification challenge, I utilize moment inequalities implied by the bidder��s
                  bidding history to estimate the value distribution and develop a structural econometric model to
                  study the effect of information asymmetry on bidding behavior. The paper finds that the information
                  premium mainly comes from the informed bidder��s screening effect and is independent of the number
                  of participants. Applying the data from Chinese Justice Auction, the estimation result shows that the
                  noisy part in signal is very large.
